# KivyCardGames

Kivy app with multiple card games.

First instantiation contains navigation to functional War card game (high card wins) and empty Blackjack game.

Next steps are to clean up War game code and complete a post-game popup window class for winner declaration and navigation options.

Follow standard Python/Kivy documentation to use/modify this project. 

Keep doing and learning.
